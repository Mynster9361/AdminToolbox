# AdminToolbox
The AdminToolbox Powershell Module has multiple dependency modules that are intended to provide a swiss army knife of semi-random tools. I am adding to it over time. I recommend if using any of the modules, install the AdminToolbox module. It will install the other required modules, it has some functions that are useful for function discovery, and it provides some environment options.

If the above workflow shows a status other than passing, the code is being developed. Wait for it to show passed, or download the module from Powershell Gallery.

### To get started

```Powershell
Install-Module AdminToolbox -Allowclobber -Force
```
