# AdminToolbox
The AdminToolbox Powershell Module has multiple dependency modules that are intended to provide a swiss army knife of semi-random tools. I am adding to it over time as I have need for new functions. I recommend if using any of the modules to install the primary module. It has some functions that are useful for function discovery and provides some environment options.

* *__To get started__*

```Powershell
Install-Module AdminToolbox -Allowclobber -Global -Force
```
